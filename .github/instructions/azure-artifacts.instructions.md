# Artifact Generation Rules - MANDATORY

> **CRITICAL**: This file is the ENFORCEMENT TRIGGER for artifact H2 headings.
> All agents MUST use these EXACT headings when generating artifacts.
> Violations block commits (pre-commit) and PRs (CI validation).

> [!NOTE]
> This instruction file and the `azure-artifacts` skill (`SKILL.md`) intentionally
> contain the same H2 heading lists. The `SKILL.md` is the authoritative source;
> this instruction file is the enforcement trigger via `applyTo` scope.
> For template mapping, generation workflow, styling, and standard components,
> read the SKILL.md directly.

## Complete H2 Heading Reference

> **IMPORTANT**: Copy-paste these headings. Do not paraphrase or abbreviate.
