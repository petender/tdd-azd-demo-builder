{project description in max 5 lines}

below are just some examples, update with the actual scenario names from the templates and deployment

- TMLABAppSvcPlan-%region% - Azure App Service Plan in each region
- TMLABWebApp-%region% - Azure App Service with static HTML webpage in each region

### 2. What can I demo from this scenario after deployment

<use this below example as a scenario for what a good demo flow looks like

>

1. Navigate to the Resource Group, and explain the different Azure resources deployed in each region.
1. Open one of the WebApp Resources in a region; navigate to the URL and open the actual website.
1. Do the same for a WebApp in a different region, highlighting they are 3 identical websites.
1. Navigate to the **Traffic Manager Profile**, highlighting the 3 different endpoints. Open one of the endpoints and emphasize the region it points to
1. Browse to the Traffic Manager URL using its DNS Name property (https://tmlabxyz.trafficmanager.net). As there is no TLS certificate configured for the website, nor the Traffic Mgr load balancer, it will throw an error.

<br></br>

1. From the Browser error appearing, click **Continue to... (not recommended)**
1. Highlight the website is showing through the load balancing Traffic Manager URL. It should say the region is "Central US".

1. Navigate back to the Azure App Service resource in Central US.
1. Stop the App Service
1. Once stopped, navigate to the tmlabwebapp-centralUS web page; refresh the page and confirm it shows stopped.

<br></br>

1. Switch back to the Traffic Manager Profile, and confirm (or refresh until...) the **Endpoint 0** shows a state of **Degraded**
