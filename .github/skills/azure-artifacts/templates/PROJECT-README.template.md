## ⬇️ Installation

[Azure Developer CLI - AZD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
When installing AZD, the above the following tools will be installed on your machine as well, if not already installed:

- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
- [Bicep CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install)
  You need Owner or Contributor access permissions to an Azure Subscription to deploy the scenario.

## 🚀 Deploying the scenario in 4 steps:

1. Create a new folder on your machine.

```shell
mkdir <your repo link> e.g. petender/azd-hubspoke
```

1. Next, navigate to the new folder.

```shell
cd <your repo link> e.g. petender/azd-hubspoke
```

1. Next, run azd init to initialize the deployment.

```shell
azd init -t <your repo link> e.g. petender/azd-hubspoke
```

1. Last, run azd up to trigger an actual deployment.

```shell
azd up
```

⏩ Note: you can delete the deployed scenario from the Azure Portal, or by running azd down from within the initiated folder.

## What is the demo scenario about?
